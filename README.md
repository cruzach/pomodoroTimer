# Pomodoro Timer
This timer will help people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
It will vibrate to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on a working period of 25 minutes, 
followed by a break period of 5 minutes. 
This was my first project built using React Native, and is intended for use on mobile devices.

## Credit to CS50M on Edx
I am currently working through the Mobile App Development with React Native course offered through Harvard's online presence on Edx, and this is one of the in-class projects. Highly recommend the course!
